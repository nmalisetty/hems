# Highly Efficient Media Streaming (HEMS)
Utilizes the power of cloud computing and the latest [AV1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1) codec to stream high quality videos using lower bandwidth than the current industry standards like [HEVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding) (H.265) and [AVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding) (H.264).

Technologies used:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerization.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the database.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as the server.
- [React.js](https://react.dev/) for frontend.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) for backend and APIs.
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for production build and minimizing.
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) for authentication.

Development environment:
- [Jetbrains WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) as the IDE.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) for collaboration.
- [Jetstream2](https://jetstream-cloud.org/) as the cloud computing environment.
